    "\n",
    "Having the same consistent state across the cluster means that in case of a failure, any Manager node can pick up the tasks and restore the services to a stable state. For example, if the Leader Manager which is responsible for scheduling tasks in the cluster dies unexpectedly, any other Manager can pick up the task of scheduling and re-balance tasks to match the desired state.\n",

    "Systems using consensus algorithms to replicate logs in a distributed systems do require special care. They ensure that the cluster state stays consistent in the presence of failures by requiring a majority of nodes to agree on values.\n",

    "Raft tolerates up to (N-1)/2 failures and requires a majority or quorum of (N/2)+1 members to agree on values proposed to the cluster. This means that in a cluster of 5 Managers running Raft, if 3 nodes are unavailable, the system cannot process any more requests to schedule additional tasks. The existing tasks keep running but the scheduler cannot rebalance tasks to cope with failures if the manager set is not healthy."
