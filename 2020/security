        Docker Content Trust provides a secure way to verify the integrity of images before you pull or run them on your systems
        With DCT, the image creator signs each image with a certificate, which clients can use to verify the image before running it

            docker trust key generate arashid290
        
        Generate a delegation key pair. This gives users access to sign images for a respository. 

            docker trust signer add --key <key file> <signer name> <repo> 

            docker trust sign <repo>:<tag> 

    => Default Docker Engine Security 

        Namespaces and Control Groups (cgroups) provide isolation to containers. 
        Isolation means that container processes cannot see or affect other containers or processes running directly on the host system. 
        This limits the impact of certain exploits or privilege escalation attacks. 
        If one container is compromised, it is less likely that it can be used to gain any further access outside the container.

        -> Docker daemon attack surface 
            - docker daemon itself requires root 
            - only allow trusted users to access the daemon
